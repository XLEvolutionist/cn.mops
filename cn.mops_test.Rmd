Jeff mentioned that I should examine the cnv calls of [cn.ops](http://www.bioinf.jku.at/software/cnmops/) using TIL01 and TIL11 which already have cnvs called using a chip in a [Swanson-Wagner](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21036921) paper. The issue I can foresee is that the analysis was done with the maize refercne version 2, whereas we re working with maize ref3... Perhaps this means having to convert co-ordinates, or revert back to maize 2 to assess the hit rate of cn.mops.
